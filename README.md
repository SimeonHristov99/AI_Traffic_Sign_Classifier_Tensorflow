# AI_Traffic_Sign_Classifier_Tensorflow

The goal of this project is to build and train a traffic sign classifier. Results were generated in the context of the second  stage  of  the [GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark](https://www.kaggle.com/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign) dataset. The classifier is a convolutional neural network and is implemented using the deep learning framework [Keras](https://keras.io/) from the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) library.
